					<h4>
						Making Your First MIDI Sequence
					</h4>
				</div>

				<div class="panel-body">

					<p class="text">
						Open up Sect again.<br/>
						<br/>
						To create a new sequence, hit <b>Shift-Enter</b>. This will bring up many new elements in the Sequence-Grid panel.<br/>
						<br/>
						Without annotations:<br/>
						<br/>
						<img src="img/screen2.png" /><br/>
						<br/>
						With annotations:<br/>
						<br/>
						<img src="img/screen3.png" /><br/>
						<br/>
						<b>A</b> - Active note. C-0 corresponds to MIDI-NOTE 0; G-10 corresponds to MIDI-NOTE 127.<br/>
						<br>
						<b>B</b> - Active tick. A tick is a sub-unit of a beat. The default value is 24 TPQ (Ticks Per Quaver), making for 96 ticks per beat.<br/>
						<br/>
						<b>C</b> - Reticule. This marks the location where the active note and the active tick meet. Its rightmost triangle, which falls to the right of circle "C" in the example image, shows how long a note would be if it were created.<br/>
						<br/>
						The reticule's default colors are: bright aqua while recording in Play Mode; mellow blue and white when not recording in Play Mode; bright yellow when recording in Generator Mode; and dusky yellow-brown when not recording in Generator Mode. You'll learn about modes later on.<br/>
						<br/>
						<b>D</b> - Active sequence.<br/>
						<br/>
						<b>E</b> - List of all currently-loaded sequences. Each sequence corresponds to a MIDI track. This panel is clickable!<br/>
						<br/>
						<b>F</b> - Beat-triangle. These triangles are attached to each beat-tick, and show which beat it is. Since we've just created a new sequence, all beat-triangles in the example image are labeled "1", as the new sequence is only 1 beat long.<br/>
						<br/>
						<b>G</b> - Currently playable notes. These correspond to a piano-layout on the letter keys of your keyboard, and they will jump upwards or downwards depending on which octave the Reticule is in.<br/>
						<br/>
						Here's the default layout for the keyboard-piano:<br/>
						<br/>
						<img src="img/screen4.png" /><br/>
						<br/>
						You can use these keys to enter any of the currently playable notes. Or, you can hit <b>Enter</b> to enter the active note.<br/>
						<br/>
						So, let's navigate to your octave of choice with <b>Up</b>, <b>Down</b>, <b>Shift-Up</b> and <b>Shift-Down</b>, and enter some notes!<br/>
						<br/>
						<img src="img/screen5.png" /><br/>
						<br/>
						But what's this? The sequence is so short that you could only enter four notes! Well, worry not: there are commands to give you various types of control here.<br/>
						<br/>
						First, we need to shorten those notes. Hit <b>Ctrl-A</b> for Select-All, then <b>Shift-Tab-Left</b> a few times to shorten their duration.<br/>
						<br/>
						Okay, I lied. Use <b>Shift-Tab-Right</b> to lengthen them again, and <b>Ctrl-Shift-A</b> to clear selection.<br/>
						<br/>
						You could make a ridiculously quick sequence by reducing Spacing (<b>Semicolon</b>, <b>Apostrophe</b>, <b>Shift-Semicolon</b>, <b>Shift-Apostrophe</b>) and Duration (<b>Square brackets</b>, <b>Shift-Square brackets</b>), or a sequence with slower notes by moving them in the other direction.<br/>
						<br/>
						But how do we lengthen the sequence itself, to hold more notes? To add a number of ticks equal to the Spacing value, hit <b>Tab-Enter</b>. Note that, if you do this in the middle of a sequence that contains notes, the notes to the right of the Reticule will be pushed forward.<br/>
						<br/>
						Change the notes' MIDI channel with <b>Ctrl-Square brackets</b>, their velocity with <b>dash</b>, <b>equals</b>, <b>Shift-dash</b>, <b>Shift-equals</b>, and play around putting a sequence together.<br/>
						<br/>
						So now that we have a sequence, how do we save it?<br/>
						<br/>
						<b>Ctrl-S</b> will save it to the current hotseat. You can tab between hotseats with <b>Ctrl-number</b> and <b>Shift-Number</b>, and load the hotseat-file's contents with <b>Ctrl-O</b>.<br/>
						<br/>
						Remember that hotseat filenames can be changed in your user-prefs.lua.<br/>

						You may have noticed that, so far, Sect is silent. Because of LOVE2D's limitations, Sect cannot route MIDI on its own, but there is a Puredata script to help.<br/>

						<img src="img/screen6.png" /><br/>
						<br/>
						For Puredata to send MIDI notes itself, we have to change its MIDI settings.<br/>
						<br/>
						Go to Pd-extended's main window, open the "Media" menu, and select "MIDI Settings..."<br/>

						Click the box to the right of "Output device 1", and a menu will pop up, displaying all currently-existing MIDI devices. Select your device of choice from the list; then, click "Apply" and "OK".<br/>
						<br/>
						Sect should now send MIDI-NOTEs to that MIDI device, as long as both Sect and test-osc.pd are running at the same time.

						Advanced Editing

				</div>

				<div class="panel-body">

					<p class="text">
						Now that you have all of the basics down, it's time to learn a few helpful advanced techniques.<br/>
						<br/>
						Undo and Redo are <b>Ctrl-Z</b> and <b>Ctrl-Y</b>, respectively.<br/>
						<br/>
						The default depth of undo-memory is 100 steps, but you can change this in user-prefs.lua.<br/>
						<br/>
						A selection-window can be created with <b>Ctrl-Comma</b> and <b>Ctrl-Period</b>, and dismissed with <b>Ctrl-Slash</b>. All notes whose first tick falls within this window will be highlighted as the current selection.<br/>
						<br/>
						Copy is <b>Ctrl-C</b>, Cut is <b>Ctrl-X</b>, and Paste is <b>Ctrl-V</b>. Copy and Cut act upon the currently-highlighted notes.<br/>
						<br/>
						Notes will be copied/pasted based on their tick-position in relation to the Reticule. Note-position will remain the same.<br/>
						<br/>
						Additive Copy and Additive Cut are <b>Ctrl-Shift-C</b> and <b>Ctrl-Shift-X</b>. These will add notes to the currently-copied notes, rather than overwriting them. Again, notes are copied and pasted with positions relative to the Reticule.<br/>
						<br/>
						Highlighted notes can be modified in various ways:<br/>
						<ul>
							<li>Duration: <b>Shift-Tab-Left</b>, <b>Shift-Tab-Right</b></li>
							<li>Channel: <b>Shift-Tab-Up</b>, <b>Shift-Tab-Down</b></li>
							<li>Move: <b>Tab-ArrowKeys</b> (tickwise movement is based on the Spacing value)</li>
							<li>Velocity: <b>Shift-Dash</b>, <b>Shift-Equals</b>, <b>Shift-Tab-Dash</b>, <b>Shift-Tab-Equals</b></li>
							<li>Humanize: <b>Ctrl-H</b> (strength is based on current global velocity)</li>
						</ul>

						<span class="well well-sm">Default cursor! <img src="img/cursor1.gif" /></span>
						<span class="well well-sm">LeftClick cursor! <img src="img/cursor2.gif" /></span>
						<span class="well well-sm">RightClick cursor! <img src="img/cursor3.gif" /></span><br/>
						<br/>
						Notes can also be highlighted with <b>LeftClick</b> or <b>LeftClick-Drag</b>, and additively highlighted with <b>Shift-LeftClick</b> or <b>Shift-LeftClick-Drag</b>.<br/>
						<br/>
						Using <b>RightClick</b> on the Sequence Grid will move the Reticule to the clicked position; <b>RightClick</b>ing on the Track Panel will make the clicked sequence into the active-sequence.<br/>

						Advanced Modes

					<p class="text">
						Now that you know how to send MIDI-OUT through test-osc.pd, you might have become annoyed at Sect's tendency to record every note that you play! Well, there's a handy solution to that: <b>Escape</b> toggles Recording on-and-off.<br/>
						<br/>
						To play through the active sequence in realtime, hit <b>Space</b>.<br/>
						<br/>
						Sometimes it is useful to view multiple sequences at once. For this reason, Shadow Mode exists. In any sequence, hit <b>Backspace</b>, and that sequence's notes will be displayed as shadows underneath the notes of the active sequence. Shadow Mode can be applied to multiple sequences simultaneously.<br/>
						<br/>
						It can also be useful to see what shadows are underneath the current sequence's notes. So, to toggle whether to display or hide the active sequence's notes, hit <b>Shift-Backspace</b>.

					<h4>
						Generator Mode
					</h4>
				</div>

				<div class="panel-body">

					<p class="text">
						Generator Mode is a way to quickly generate a sequence of notes, within a given range of notes and ticks, as an alternative inroad to composition.<br/>
						<br/>
						Let's give it a whirl. Hit <b>Shift-Space</b> to enter Generator Mode. The reticule should change color.<br/>
						<br/>
						<img src="img/screen9.png" /><br/>
						<br/>
						To automatically generate a potentially-interesting sequence, hit any keyboard-piano key, or <b>Enter</b>. The sequence will be generated in the octave above the note, including the note itself.<br/>
						<br/>
						Here is an explanation of every sequence-generation parameter, and the key-commands to change them:<br/>
						<br/>
						"K-Species": <b>Shift-W</b> up, <b>Shift-Q</b> down.<br/>
						The number of notes in a given 12-note scale. A lower value will produce chord-like behavior. Due to exponential wheel-data complexity, the maximum value is 8.<br/>
						<br/>
						"Scales": <b>Shift-S</b> up, <b>Shift-A</b> down.<br/>
						The number of different scale-types to grab while generating the sequence.<br/>
						<br/>
						"Wheels": <b>Tab-S</b> up, <b>Tab-A</b> down.<br/>
						A wheel controls the order in which a scale's notes are played. This value controls the number of different wheels used while generating a sequence.<br/>
						<br/>
						"Consonance": <b>Shift-X</b> up, <b>Shift-Z</b> down, <b>Tab-X</b> up 10, <b>Tab-Z</b> down 10.<br/>
						How consonant or dissonant the selected scales will be. The more scales are pulled by the "Scales" value, though, the more they will diverge from the desired consonance rating.<br/>
						<br/>
						"Scale Switch": <b>Shift-R</b> up, <b>Shift-E</b> down, <b>Tab-R</b> up 10, <b>Tab-E</b> down 10.<br/>
						How likely the generator is to switch to a different scale after any given note.<br/>
						<br/>
						"Wheel Switch": <b>Shift-F</b> up, <b>Shift-D</b> down, <b>Tab-F</b> up 10, <b>Tab-D</b> down 10.<br/>
						How likely the generator is to switch to a different wheel after any given note.<br/>
						<br/>
						"Density": <b>Shift-V</b> up, <b>Shift-C</b> down, <b>Tab-V</b> up 10, <b>Tab-C</b> down 10.<br/>
						Controls how densely-packed the sequence will be. Higher density, more notes.<br/>
						<br/>
						"Beat Stick": <b>Shift-Y</b> up, <b>Shift-T</b> down, <b>Tab-Y</b> up 10, <b>Tab-T</b> down 10.<br/>
						Stickiness of major beat-factors. 100: fully prioritize major beats. 0: no special beat priority.<br/>
						<br/>
						"Beat Length": <b>Shift-H</b> up, <b>Shift-G</b> down, <b>Tab-H</b> up 10, <b>Tab-G</b> down 10.<br/>
						Secondary beat-length value, decoupled from global TPQ, to be used only while generating the sequence. If you want the sequence to reflect the global TPQ, set this value to be identical to global TPQ.<br/>
						<br/>
						"Beat Bound": <b>Shift-N</b> up, <b>Shift-B</b> down.<br/>
						Number of beats, in total, that the generated sequence will cover. Keep in mind that this refers to the Beat-Length-based beats, not the TPQ-based beats.<br/>
						<br/>
						"Beat Grain": <b>Shift-I</b> up, <b>Shift-U</b> down, <b>Tab-I</b> up 10, <b>Tab-U</b> down 10.<br/>
						Granularity of ticks that are considered for note placement. Smaller number, more incidental; larger number, more beat-focused.<br/>
						<br/>
						"Note Grain": <b>Shift-K</b> up, <b>Shift-J</b> down, <b>Tab-K</b> up 10, <b>Tab-J</b> down 10.<br/>
						Minimal possible note length. Smaller number, shorter average durations; larger number, longer average durations.
