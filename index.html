						You should see a loading screen as Sect generates its data files; this might take a few seconds, but it will be faster on all subsequent launches.<br/>

						After the loading screen is done, this window should appear:<br/>

						Making Our First MIDI Sequence
					</h4>
				</div>

				<div class="panel-body">

					<p class="text">
						To create a new sequence, hit <b>Shift-Enter</b>. This will bring up many new elements in the Sequence-Grid panel.<br/>
						<br/>
						Without annotations:<br/>
						<br/>
						<img src="img/screen2.png" /><br/>
						<br/>
						With annotations:<br/>
						<br/>

						<br/>
						<b>A:</b> Active note. C-0 corresponds to MIDI-NOTE 0; G-10 corresponds to MIDI-NOTE 127.<br/>
						<br>
						<b>B:</b> Active tick. A tick is a sub-unit of a beat. The default value is 24 TPQ (Ticks Per Quaver), making for 96 ticks per beat.<br/>
						<br/>
						<b>C:</b> Reticule. This marks the location where the active note and the active tick meet. Its rightmost triangle, which falls to the right of circle "C" in the example image, shows how long a note would be if it were created.<br/>
						<br/>
						The reticule's default colors are: bright aqua while recording in Play Mode; mellow blue and white when not recording in Play Mode; bright yellow when recording in Generator Mode; and dusky yellow-brown when not recording in Generator Mode. You'll learn about modes later on.<br/>
						<br/>
						<b>D:</b> Active sequence.<br/>
						<br/>
						<b>E:</b> List of all currently-loaded sequences. Each sequence corresponds to a MIDI track. This panel is clickable!<br/>
						<br/>
						<b>F:</b> Beat-triangle. These triangles are attached to each beat-tick, and show which beat it is. Since we've just created a new sequence, all beat-triangles in the example image are labeled "1", as the new sequence is only 1 beat long.<br/>
						<br/>
						<b>G:</b> Currently playable notes. These correspond to a piano-layout on the letter keys of your keyboard, and they will jump upwards or downwards depending on which octave the Reticule is in.<br/>
						<br/>
						Here's the default layout for the keyboard-piano:<br/>
						<br/>
						<img src="img/screen4.png" /><br/>
						<br/>
						You can use these keys to enter any of the currently playable notes. Or, you can hit <b>Enter</b> to enter the active note.<br/>
						<br/>
						So, let's enter some notes!<br/>
